# Dictionary UI

Simple responsive Reactjs web app created for fun.  

As the user types within the search bar, words that start with the user input are asyncronously loaded onto the page.  Clicking on one of the words will direct the user to the word's definition page.  


## Getting Started

Make sure you have [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com) installed.  

This frontend web app relies on its backend counterpart [`dictionary-api`](https://github.com/DerekSeverson/dictionary-api).  So, make sure you read those README instructions on how to setup and run that service.  

### Install

Install the dependencies via `yarn`.  

```bash
$ yarn install
```

### Usage

Run the `dictionary-ui` app locally. 

```bash
$ yarn start
```
